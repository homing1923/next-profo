## Description

This is program re-built project.
The company of the existing program was bankrupted so the source code is lost. They needed upgrade the system with new av equipment so we have the job. 

The whole system needed to be rebuild, started by surveying, system drafting, programming, deploying, handovering, training, and continouing maintaining.


## Participation

<Steps>
### Initiation
 
- Conducting site survey for the existing system and create the system diagram.

This is the schematic diagram of the processor.

### Planing
 
- Creating new system diagrams based on site survey.

- Creating wiring diagrams based on preliminary equipment diagrams on CAD software (AutoCAD, GstarCAD).

### Execution

- Programming control systems using manufacturer-provided software such as SIMPL Windows/SIMPL+/SIMPL# for Crestron.
- Programming audio processors (DSP) such as Control Space for Bose, Shure Designer for Shure, etc.
- Integrating those systems into a single system, programming all controllers to communicate with each other.
- Creating graphical human interfaces for the user, such as VTproE in Crestron, and Integration Designer in RTi.

### Closure (Continuous)

- Creating user manuals for functions and feature that the system provided.
- Providing user training on how to use the system.
- Performing after-sale on-site maintenance and remote troubleshooting services.
