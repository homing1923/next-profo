## Participation

<Steps>

### Planing
- Creating wiring diagrams based on preliminary equipment diagrams on CAD software (AutoCAD, GstarCAD).

The building limited the way of wiring for the boards, some deadzone which cannot be reached after construction finished. 

This is the draft of the way of wiring.
