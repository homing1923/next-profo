# South Bay Security System

# Soubth Bay Road 14

## Description

This a renovation project replacing the existing over 10 years system with a new access control system using suprema [BioStar 2](https://www.supremainc.com/en/platform/hybrid-security-platform-biostar-2.asp).

Entry devices, i.e. [W2](https://www.supremainc.com/en/hardware/compact-outdoor-fingerprint-device-bioentry-w2.asp) and [BioStation](https://www.supremainc.com/en/hardware/outdoor-fingerprint-terminal-biostation-2.asp) were in used for out-doors and a lift controller [OM120](https://www.supremainc.com/en/hardware/pd_om-120.asp) was in used for a master-privated lift with scheduled access control.

The role of myself in this project is program setup, deploy, handover and user training.
