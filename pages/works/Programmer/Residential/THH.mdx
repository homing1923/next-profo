# Tai Hang Hau Valley

## Description

This is a full house renovation project, upgrading AV equipments and adding more lighting devices. And as always, the program source code was missing for sure so it started with a site-survey, drafting system design proposals, fine tuning design and schematics, programming, testing debugging deploying, and finally handovering.

## Participation

### Initiation
 
- Site survey for the existing system and create the system diagram.

### Execution

- Programming control systems using manufacturer-provided software, BioStation for this time.

### Closure (Continuous)

- Performing after-sale on-site maintenance and remote troubleshooting services. Training the user how to manage the access right and control as required.
