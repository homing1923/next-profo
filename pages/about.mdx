# About

This page is not related to any job / academic. Just talking about myself.

## Languages

### Cantonese and Mandarin
I am a HongKongese, lived there for 28 yrs. That's why my mother tongue is Cantonese. Knowing Mandarin of course cus for me it is just a various version of Cantonese.

### English
Like most of people in Hong Kong, english is complusory but not daily. We learnt how to use but mostly that just for academic. 


### Japanese
Affected by my parent, anime entered my life very earily in my childhood. And which became the reason why I learnt Japanese on my own. After 10+ years of immersion, I tried to take the JPLT N2 @2018 and I got 178/180 without taking any lesson beforehand. 

No more subtitle needed in youtube/movie/anime!
